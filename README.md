# AI Resume Bullet Point Generator (Prompt Engineering Demo)

**What it is:** A small prompt-engineering experiment that converts job descriptions + candidate info into 2-3 resume bullets.

**Why I built it:** As a fresher, I wanted a practical prompt-engineering task related to careers — useful, simple, and human-editable.

**What you’ll find:**
- `prompts/` — base and refined prompt templates
- `examples/` — sample job description and candidate info
- `outputs/` — example generated bullets (mocked)
- `resume_bullet_generator.ipynb` — notebook showing attempts and notes

**How to use (manual):**
1. Open `examples/job_description.txt` and `examples/candidate_info.txt` and edit them.
2. Open the notebook and run cells; it uses a mock generator so you can see iteration without API keys.
3. Copy the refined bullets into your resume and edit for accuracy.

**Notes:** This project is intentionally simple and shows prompt iteration. Outputs are NOT final — they need human editing to be recruiter-ready.
